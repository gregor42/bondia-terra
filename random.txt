So it came to me, that I might be the only one who ever sees this.

But that really can't be the case.  I mean sure, I might be the only human that ever interacts with this document, but surely
there will be some automated process that will come across it SOMETIME and interact with it in some way.
So how could I ever hope to communicate with it?  It might not be receptive in any way...

I could embed odd bits of code into the file in the hopes that they might be parsed randomly & executed, but that seems 
somewhat superflous, no?  Almost WISHFUL THINKING ...

If I put something actually USEFUL here then other humans might peruse it after all... (!)

I'm not sure what to make of that.

Is this open-source thing really FOR me?  Do I like to share?  

I'm not sure.  I mean I sure like being on the receiving end of the sharing deal...  I like reusing existing code.

It is probably ethically positivie &/or responsible to share code BACK.

It doesn't really matter.  The question is more of buckets & how long they can sit around before someone tries to clean them
out.  Is there something unique sitting in the bottom of it?  Can we LEVERAGE it?  Am I reading too far into this?

I'm not the trusting type.  Why bother when everyone is out only for themselves?

Sure it SOUNDS like a great idea to just post all of your ideas for everyone else to share in.  You can CLAIM things that way.
But besides the bragging rights & helping the Chinese Army tool up for the next cyberwar, how am I really Making A Difference?

Sharing depends a LOT on context.  Just dangling things out in the open usually has a certain charm right up to the point where
someone else comes along & starts to subvert the core purpose, no?
