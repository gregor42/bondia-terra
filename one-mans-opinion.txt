Let's just call this all what it is - an experiment.

I am trying to see what I am going to end up using most of the time, GitHub, BitBucket or SourceForge...

I have to say that the whole Must Pay To Be Private thing here is a real buzzkill.

That being said - this wiki-text based editor doesn't suck and this is the only place that has it.
