20 days in... oh yeah.

------


I am on a 15 day streak of contributions - thanks to me connecting to a desktop remotely from my iphone with Teamviewer & 
commiting a itsy-bitsy change just larger than a TOUCH while away at a wedding.

I find the green squares next to my Minecraft creeper face avatar to be *quite fitting*.

OK we have now shit the proverbial bed.

The contribution below registers for today - but the Issue that I created counts for tomorrow.  And I did that hours ago.

Like SRSLY WTF?

------

The green squares have rebelled.  I apparently did my work too late in the day & it counted it as what appears to me to be
tomorrow by my local timezone reckoning...

I wonder what they use?  GMT?  One would only assume so.  Now I am curious.

-------

I am compelled to keep messing with the Little Green Squares.

I have a 6 day streak.  What Does That MEAN?  I mean in the Reality kind of perspective?

Not a lot.

But I have been trying all kinds of stuff just to see what all the fuss is about.

I am nowhere NEAR making a decision.

The security features in git bug me and intrigue me at the same time.

The mixture of the email address requirement and the SHA-1 hashes means that there IS some kind of fingerprinting mechanism

But from Linus' point of view - that is a GOOD THING.... right?

I am unsure.

THE MOST LIKELY approach will probably be to maintain multiple repositories.

THAT in itself will probably become a project.

I should go write that down.  More green!

-------

Let's just call this all what it is - an experiment.

I am trying to see what I am going to end up using most of the time, GitHub, BitBucket or SourceForge...

I have to say that the whole Must Pay To Be Private thing here is a real buzzkill.

That being said - this wiki-text based editor doesn't suck and this is the only place that has it.
