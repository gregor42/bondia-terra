This time I tried to watch a video.

Dorky skinny dude wearing a blue T-shirt and affected hipster nerd glasses.

So here I go & I'm looking to learn.

At OS/X terminal I begin:

blackwash:~ gregor42$ man git

NAME
       git - the stupid content tracker


cntl-C cntl-C cntl-C *cntl-C* **cntl-C** !!!

::Deep breaths::

::Nervously get up and pace around aimlessly for a few minutes.::

Back to terminal...

I have to poke around & find out if this everything-in-lower-case-with-no-spaces *thing* is The Protocol, or if I am imagining
such things in my over-zealous analysis of ShitHUb culture.

Gah.  Imagine me as a n00b again.  Ugh.. Fuuuuuck y'all.  I've done this sooooo many times before & yet...

Here we go again.

So the New Dimension of this experiment is going to involve :gasp: ME using Git.   (!?!?!)

WhyTF would I do this?  

Simple.

I have ALWAYS maintained that you cannot bash something in any genuine way without first giving it the proper fair shake & seeing 
if you actually have it sussed out or if you've perhaps, as happens too often, *missed the point*.

This isn't the first time we have met.

We have danced before.

Back then I chose Mercurial over you...  And we have had glorious times together.

It is only for the sake of this Peer Pressure shit that I am indulging in this presumably masochistic exercise.

It simply would not do to talk out of one's ass about things with which one was not properly acquianited.

Thus .. Renewed Acquaintance.
