I worry too much.  I need to just Go For It more.  This is a PROBLEM.

Analysis Paralysis.

If I would just adopt the more pragmatic and somewhat shell-shocked viewpoint where my only expectation is failure
then maybe my disappointment level will stop figuring into the analysis...

Nope.  I just can't keep it together & the graph is plotting my own brand of bipolarity on a graph.  It looks like my downswing
will equal the uptick.  How utterly BORING.

Yay, a net gain of 0...

It is almost painful to keep logging in & doing this.  But I'm TRYING.  That's how these things work right?

I mean - i had an idea to make yet another open source project for prublishing a problem that I solved at work...

It THAt the move?

It's hard to be sure when I get in this kind of FUNK.

----

20141013.0900

It is difficult to keep at it.  Again - it this one of those biploarity-curves?  I'm not sure.  I make these token
efforts to try to stay current.  And even that seems like an effort sometimes.

And yet - There is SO MUCH that I want to do for Johnny for example...  It is all about time and focus.  I have neither
available.

But I WILL say that I find it completely unacceptable that there is no iPad-specific client that would allow you to edit
code in the repository.  Essentially a simplified version of git with a UI.  Is this just verboten or something?  WTF?

{This is yet another reason why I want to give up using the iPad in favor of a MacBook Pro or a Novena - mobile devices
are increasingly hobbled and locked deeper & deeper in the Walled Garden...}

It has all gotten away from me a little bit.  But I am trying to get my momentum up again.

it occurs to me that the green-box chart might not actually survive the year that I would need to populate it.  

There's a calming aspect to that thought.  The whole idea of chasing dragons & grails is that when you get to the end
there's no There there.  So calm down, don't be in a rush & enjoy the journey.

That being said - WTF is with all of the iOS apps for GitHub and none of you actually let you edit code!?

Oh & here's another thought - since we track events based on creative contributions - it might be possible to graph with
some accuracy the cycles of mania & depression in a bipolar contributor..

Stick that in your USB device & vaporize it.

20140913.0945

I continue to fight with Git.  I can do branching cleanly on github but not with git itself.

I end up fighting with it.

I have to try again & remain calm because this is increasingly frustrating.

----

20140908.1600

I have been at this for a while now.  I *still* engage in hand-to-hand combat with git at the command line.  I have
*concepts* down but not the syntax.

I **failed miserably** trying to automate pushes from my local repository to GitHub.  I *still* don't know what I'm 
doing wrong but trying to use *cron* or *at* just never worked.  Maybe I can write a Python script to call out 
to the shell....

I have a 15 day streak of contributions going - for all that is worth.  But if nothing else it gives me an excuse to 
keep at it day after day.

I *am* learning - though of course not as quickly as I would like.

----

20140829.1151

I am a few days into things now.  I have gotten past my initial n00boscity & have been swimming in the Kool-Aid.

I went so far as to spin up **two** open source projects even.  (We all need to give back to the community)

I ***still*** can't commit anything from an iOS device through Safari however, which is pure unadulturated bullshit.

I will admit that it took watching Linus Torvalds talk about Git at Google for me to start to grok 
whereTF they are coming from with a lot of this.  I GET it - at least a lot more than I did before.

But .. all of that being said - I am still of the opinion that hg is a better fit for Enterprise Software Development.

That being said however, this is not a *bias* as much as an opinion that I support with argument & fact.

The debate is not *over*.

-=-=-=-=-

On the topic of Green however - I find it interesting that yesterday I committed 2 changes - so it is a light green day.

But those two changes were by far the most *significant* changes I have yet posted.

So you are rewarded for the number of commits - rather than their value individually.

That's good to know in un-wiring the gold-star/bananna-sticker reward system mentality.

Having just faced down the "Commit changes" button being disabled for reasons of incomplete web=form-ness/age/ocity -- I am
now forced to wonder if my experience with the iPad wasn't simply something similar.

I will need to try that again.

And now I went ahead & made that second repository.

But to get it to import I had to do some weird & cryptic shit:
git remote add origin https://github.com/gregor42/sloppy-secundus.git
git push -u origin master

Dude - what kind of freakin' demon are we summoning here?

WhatTF is a remote?  I read the docs & it explains How To Add them and How to Manage them -- but not What They Are.

What is origin?  Is that a convention?  It appears to be an arbitrary name..?
now I have to puzzle over the -u option for push and master, I believe, is the default branch... :sigh: n00b city man... FUUUUUU

I DID however find a button under that for importing code from Subversion or Mercurial...

Interesting that since I actually did a search for the term 'Mercurial' on the site & came up with nothing.

Yet-another-undocumented-shithub-feature

I will have to go ahead & make yet another repository & do so by cloning an hg based project as an experiment.

20140822.2005

More trouble.

I was *so happy* too.. I had opened up this file & wrote how wonderful I thought it was that the web site looked & felt on
my iPad exactly as it does on the compyter.  

Back when The Steve was alive & the first iPhone came out - we didn't HAVE apps & the promise was that with HTML5 everything
would look the same on iOS as on the computer.

Fast forward to today & EVERY site has an app that they was to FORCE you to use instead of their website - which they will
intentionally break on you if you are not running a browser released in the last 6 months...

And when I went to SAVE the changes that I made on the web site...  IRONY struck like a meteor as the Commit changes button
**did not work**.

So yeah.... You can LOOK, and go through the motions of changing things, but you cannot save without their app & that requires 
iOS 7.

THEN I tried creating a new project from scratch from the command line.

I was able to handle the creation of the repository & adding the files.  It is close enough to Mercurial to guess my way through
but when I wanted to work with GitHub...  Oh HO!  You want to work with a repository?  WHICH repository?  Because you're NOT 
creating one through git nor from the command line.

You are *required* to use the web site to create a repository.  That's quite the kick in the workflow guys.  Thanks...

Even after all that I watched about 1/2 hour of Linus Torvalds at Google talking about Git.  He mentioned Mercurial, almost 
begrudgingly and just said that you shouldn't use it because their interface is better.  (!?)  There is NO reality warping
field in effect around this guy.  I call BULLSHIT.

20140822.1640

And now the ugly truth.  I got to the end of the document (because I blew off using SSH for now) and under Next Steps of
things to try - the Be Social link was the only thing left.

And here we see WHY GitHub is successful - for the same reasons why Facebook is successful.  It Makes People Feel Important.

Do I really need to "follow" the progress of other developers?  Are we setting up fan-clubs now?  This cult-of-personality 
thing is ugly.  No wonder this is a Linus-worship-zone.

::puke::

IF I was in a common working group & I was waiting for people to finish things I was expecting or if these developers Worked
For Me - then I would want to follow them - but then again if this was a work situation then Open Source is likely not happening
so we wouldn't be here anyway?

What is the POINT of this then if not for an Ego Stroke?

Is that WHY we are contributing to Open Source?  For the #humblebrag?  R U SRS?

20140822.1634

The indignities I have suffered today include being 2 major revisions behind the supported OS/X GUI client.
(With BitBucket I was only one rev back)
And I am also a najor revision behind on the iOS client.

So nothing but the command line & this web-based editing right on the site to work with.

UGLY.

That & during my first attempt to commit a change I was yelled at to use git commit -a
Cryptic & annoying are my first impressions.

Honestly if not for this site propping it up - this software would already be ignored or deleted.

BUT I AM TRYING.  So cut me some slack for whinging so much.

----

20140822.1625

I have git working & I am trying it on my local desktop machine. 
Let's see if I can get this change into the web site without wanting to kill 
someone...

----

20140822.1433

So now I'm doing this thing:
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

And I know that it is already installed - so I'm thinking that I'll just cake-walk through this until I get to the commands & 
THEN ... THEN I'll finally start focusing on the work & not the miasma of the dogmatic cultural echo-chamber embued in all facets
of this 'tech-stack'.

And I got all the way to STEP 4 before I took an ice-pick to the forehead:
"Tell Git the email address that will be associated with your Git commits. The email you specify should be the same one you used 
to sign up for GitHub. To keep your email address hidden, see "Keeping your email address private"."

And *of course* the first thing that I did was to click on that link & read up on how I can basically make a proxy account 
*through GitHub* where then THEY track it back to me.

Um... WTF?

Wave Goodbye to the days of writing anonymous code?  Are you shitting me?

Look - I GET that if I'm posting things publically to ShitHub then of course people realize where it is coming from.  But 
*every* time I commit something I have to not just put some throwaway unix handle or role name on it - but an email address too?

In an age where every single piece of identifying information should be suppressed - we are gathering identity information at
the root development level?

WHY?

Now I have to create & maintain separate accounts for projects with conflicting interests and I have to worry that I NEVER set
a default global user for commits so that if I FORGET once I don't have to delve into the black art of hacking history....

Well that is some seriously unfriendly shit.

:sigh:

Now I infer that the meta-data for all of these documents is easily farmable.  Way to give up the goods By Design fellas...

This gets uglier each time I try.

I am literally getting a stomach-ache from this.

So here I go & I'm looking to learn.

At OS/X terminal I begin:

blackwash:~ gregor42$ man git

       git - the stupid content tracker


cntl-C cntl-C cntl-C *cntl-C* **cntl-C** !!!

::Nervously get up and pace around aimlessly for a few minutes.::

Back to terminal...

20140822.1345

I have to poke around & find out if this everything-in-lower-case-with-no-spaces *thing* is The Protocol, or if I am imagining
such things in my over-zealous analysis of ShitHUb culture.

----

20140822.1340

Gah.  Imagine me as a n00b again.  Ugh.. Fuuuuuck y'all.  I've done this sooooo many times before & yet...

Here we go again.

So the New Dimension of this experiment is going to involve :gasp: ME using Git.   (!?!?!)

WhyTF would I do this?  

Simple.

I have ALWAYS maintained that you cannot bash something in any genuine way without first giving it the proper fair shake & seeing 
if you actually have it sussed out or if you've perhaps, as happens too often, *missed the point*.

This isn't the first time we have met.

We have danced before.

Back then I chose Mercurial over you...  And we have had glorious times together.

It is only for the sake of this Peer Pressure shit that I am indulging in this presumably masochistic exercise.

It simply would not do to talk out of one's ass about things with which one was not properly acquianited.

Thus .. Renewed Acquaintance.
