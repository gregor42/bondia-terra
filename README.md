Get it?  Do I HAVE to be boring?

Interesting... I had no idea that this would use wiki-text markup

I can only assume that "ShitHub" is the colloquial expression around these parts?  Or is that just an old-man thing, to bash the things that you hold dear.

There is a weird sort of compulsive culture here.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.


The big problem with running a programmer-tool site like a socil media site is that a LOT of programmers are NOT social people.

I, for one, find it all VERY CUMBERSOME.

I find the green contribution-tracking squares to be like gold-stars for grade-schoolers.

The kneejerk reward system strikes me as a cross between a Pavlov conditioning mechanism and an experiment of a monkey with a button that gives him cocaine.  I inherently DISTRUST it.

But I get my green square for posting this today, don't I?
