My github n00b experience... whee - So expect me to ramble incoherently while I come up to speed on all of the features & the over-hyped FLOW.  'cause it's all about the *flow*

Interesting... I had no idea that this would use wiki-text markup.  I don't even see it mentioned in the documentation.

Wiki by default, whether you want it or not & whether you "get" that or not.

Get it?  Do I HAVE to be boring?

I can only assume that "ShitHub" is the colloquial expression around these parts?  
Or is that just an old-man thing, to bash the things that you use every day?

There is a weird sort of compulsive culture here.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.

The big problem with running a programmer-tool site like a socil media site is that a LOT of programmers are NOT social people.

I, for one, find it all VERY CUMBERSOME.  I find having to deal with other people a very draining experience.

There's more too..

I find the green contribution-tracking squares to be like gold-stars for grade-schoolers.

The kneejerk reward system strikes me as a cross between a Pavlov conditioning mechanism and an experiment of a monkey with a button that gives him cocaine.  I inherently DISTRUST it.

But I get my green square for posting this today, don't I?
Aha!  Apparently not.

So I forked this rework of the page, just for lulz.
