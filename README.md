My github n00b experience... whee - So expect me to ramble incoherently while I come up to speed on all of the features & the over-hyped FLOW.  "'cause it's all about the *flow man* ... "

Interesting... I had no idea that this would use wiki-text markup.  I didn't even see it **mentioned** in the documentation.  It's a good thing that there is that Preview tab up there.

Wiki by default, whether you want it or not & whether you "get" that or not.  

Funny thing is - I might end up using this site for this functionality more than for anything else - being as I HATE git & all... (I like it better than svn for sure, but am overdefensive of my use of hg which gets *no love* here)

Get it?  Do I HAVE to be boring?

I can only assume that "ShitHub" is the colloquial expression around these parts?  
Or is that just an old-man thing, to bash the things that you use every day?

There is a weird sort of compulsive culture here.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.

The big problem I ASSUMED WOULD EXIST with running a programmer-tool site like a social media site is that a LOT of programmers are NOT social people.  This however is not the case at all with the 20-something crowd who grew up communicating through social media tools.

Asocial people are NOT associated strictly with computers anymore.  Perhaps they are associated with Deep Code... I am not sure.


I for one, being of that ilk, find it all VERY CUMBERSOME.  I find having to deal with other people a very draining experience.

There's more too..

I find the green contribution-tracking squares to be like gold-stars for grade-schoolers.

The kneejerk reward system strikes me as a cross between a Pavlov conditioning mechanism and an experiment of a monkey with a button that gives him cocaine.  I inherently DISTRUST it.

But I get my green square for posting this today, don't I?
Aha!  Apparently not.

So I forked this rework of the page, just for lulz.

And so far it is all going swimmingly.

But but swimmingly I mean that you need to keep paddling away.  

You need to constantly expend effort just to tread water.  There is no backing down.  So get used to that too.
