Get it?  Do I HAVE to be boring?

Interesting... I had no idea that this would use wiki-text markup

I can only assume that "ShitHub" is the colloquial expression around these parts?  Or is that just an old-man thing, to bash the things that you hold dear.

There is a weird sort of compulsive culture here.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.


The big problem with running a programmer-tool site like a socil media site is that a LOT of programmers are NOT social people.

I, for one, find it all VERY CUMBERSOME.
