It would be nice to have some kind of local repo server

Not everything that I work on is Open Source

Just because I am doing something for my job shouldn't mean that I should have to pay for it personally

for that simple reason it would be nice to have this HTML5-based editor in a usable version that could be installed locally
in the enterprise.
