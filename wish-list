It would be nice to have some kind of local repo server

Not everything that I work on is Open Source

Just because I am doing something for my job shouldn't mean that I should have to pay for it personally

for that simple reason it would be nice to have this HTML5-based editor in a usable version that could be installed locally
in the enterprise.

I have found that there ARE some such things out there.  They all are a mess.  Phabricator is interesting but is written in fucking
PHP! (wtf is that?)

So this is going to take some work to Get Over.

Funny how with HG I just run hg serve & everything is just fine.... ugh!

GitLab is a Thing.

Almost anything is better than this place.  The fishbowl aspect is really cumbersome when you have to concern yourself with
how everyone is going to perceive anything that you do or say & go mining through your social media for gotchas - you KNOW damned
well that people are doing it with source code now.  WTF people!?

Look at my hand.
