It would be nice to have some kind of local repo server

Not everything that I work on is Open Source

Just because I am doing something for my job shouldn't mean that I should have to pay for it personally

for that simple reason it would be nice to have this HTML5-based editor in a usable version that could be installed locally
in the enterprise.

I have found that there ARE some such things out there.  They all are a mess.  Phabricator is interesting but is written in fucking PHP! (wtf is that?)

So this is going to take some work to Get Over.

Funny how with HG I just run hg serve & everything is just fine.... ugh!
